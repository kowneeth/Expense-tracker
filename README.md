# expense_tracker
Developed a responsive and interactive Expense Tracker using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to manage and visualize daily spending. The app allows users to add, edit, filter, and delete expenses, supports dark/light themes, localStorage persistence, and includes a custom-built bar chart for data visualization — all without external libraries.
